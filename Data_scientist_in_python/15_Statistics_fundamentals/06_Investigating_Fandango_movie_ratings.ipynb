    "# Is Fandango's rating system biased?\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and published an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) showing strong evidence suggesting that the ratings of [Fandando](https://www.fandango.com/) were inflated. Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional. This project aims to investigate more recent data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use two samples of movie ratings: one was collected by Hickey's ([link](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango)), and the other was collected after by one of Dataquest's team members ([link](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17)). The latter has data for movies released in 2016 and 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Hickey's article and the file `README.md`, we know that he used the following sampling criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015).\n",
    "* The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the file `README.md` of the other dataset, we know that the Dataquest's team member used the following sampling criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.\n",
    "* The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews (unclear how many from the `README.md` or from the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling processes were not random. Hence, the resulting samples are unlikely to be representative of the population we're interested in describing, and we need to change the goal of this project. Instead of analyzing whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis, we will study whether there's any difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies before and after Hickey's study. This new goal should also be a reasonably good proxy for our initial goal."

Also, the 2016 distribution is slightly shifted to the left relative to the 2015 distribution. This shift suggests that there was indeed a difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and 2016. Let’s analyse this in more detail by calculating the frequency tables of the two distributions."
