1) Launch a Jupyter notebook.

2) In the upper left corner, click on the Jupyter logo to go to the file tree view.

3) Click the New, then select Terminal to open the system command line and paste the following command:

tar cfzh workspace.tar.gz ~/W*

4) Once the commands run successfully, click on the Jupyter logo again to return to the file view.

5) In the file view, select workspace.tar.gz, then click Download.

6) If your zip file is larger than 100MB, you will need to split it up into smaller files instead and download each of them, using the following command:

tar cfzh - W* | split --bytes=100MB - workspace.tar.gz

7) For extracting multiple files with 7-zip, use the first file (*.gzaa). Disregard the warning.
